<h2>About us</h2>
The Finance, Analysis and Systems Support Branch (FASSB) is a key branch which supports the delivery of Employment Ontario (EO) programs and services in the Employment and Training Division (ETD) of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (MTCU).
FASSB ensures that systems, financial management processes, and accountability tools and methodologies are up-to-date, integrated, and relevant for program and service delivery. FASSB works to provide program data and analysis support for digitally-driven and evidence-based decision making to meet the EO vision.
